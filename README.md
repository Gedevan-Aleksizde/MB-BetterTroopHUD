**Multiplayer Support**\

Originally made for personal use but is now available for everyone to enjoy and benefit from.

**Open-source and MIT licensed**\
Available for public access under the permissive MIT license.\
**Note:** The icons used in the mod are derivations of Taleworld's work and are not included under the MIT license.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the mod, there are a few things that you may try in order to fix them:

- Try running the game with only this mod activated (plus its dependencies) and see if the issue persists. If not, a mod conflict is causing your issue.
- Verify game installation is correct & unaltered. If using Steam, use the "verify files" feature for your Bannerlord installation. Then try the first pointer again.
- Re-download the mod, in case some files were modified/corrupted.
- If you have had issues with other mods as well, you may consider reinstalling the game, updating drivers, etc.

If the pointers above all fails, please post a Github issue with details about your problem and your system. Include OS, game version, module-run-order for all modules used when running the mod, and whatever else you may find useful for me to know when troubleshooting.
